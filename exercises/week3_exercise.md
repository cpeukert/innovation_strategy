# Exercise week 3: S-curved Diffusion Models

In this exercise, we will dive deeper into S-curved diffusion models, aiming to expand our comprehension through two key activities:

1. **Discussion with ChatGPT:** We will engage in a discussion with ChatGPT to explore the fundamentals of S-curved diffusion models. This interactive conversation will help us grasp the core concepts and gain insights into their practical applications.

2. **Interactive Dashboard Development:** As part of this exercise, we will also work on building an interactive dashboard. This dashboard will enable us to visualize S-curves and allow for the exploration of various parameters. By doing so, we can better understand how different variables impact the diffusion model.

## Learning Goals

Throughout this exercise, we aim to achieve the following learning goals:

- **Understand the Utility of S-curves:** We will gain insights into when S-curved diffusion models are a valuable tool and when they may not be the most suitable choice. This understanding will help us make informed decisions when analyzing and modeling diffusion processes.

- **Evaluate ChatGPT as a Tutor:** This exercise provides an opportunity to assess the benefits and limitations of ChatGPT as a tutor. By discussing S-curved diffusion models with ChatGPT, we will evaluate its effectiveness in explaining complex concepts and addressing our questions. This assessment will help us determine how AI-powered assistance can complement traditional learning methods.

By the end of this exercise, we aim to enhance our knowledge of diffusion models and start to appreciate AI in educational contexts.

Let's get started and explore the world of S-curved diffusion models!
