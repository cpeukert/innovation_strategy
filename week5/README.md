# Exercise week 5: GenAI for new product development

In this exercise, we will experiment with Generative AI in the new product development process:

1. **Brainstorming with ChatGPT:** We will brainstorm ideas for a new product and work out design principles. 
Here are some categories for your inspiration.

- *Health and Wellbeing*: Wellness gadgets, mental health tools, fitness equipment, etc.

- *Sustainability*: Eco-friendly products, innovations for reducing waste, alternative energy solutions, etc.

- *Transportation and Mobility*: Personal mobility devices, car gadgets, sustainable transportation solutions, etc.

- *Toys and Games*: Educational toys, AR/VR games, board games, etc.

- *Pets and Animals*: Innovative pet care products, toys, training tools, etc.

2. **Product mock-ups:** As part of this exercise, we will also work on creating visualizations of the product ideas. We will use Bing AI's Image Creator for that. Make sure you have Microsoft Edge installed on your machine. Then click on the Bing icon on the top right and there on the icon with landscape and a paintbrush.

## Learning Goals

Throughout this exercise, we aim to achieve the following learning goals:

- **Evaluate ChatGPT and Dall-E as a new tool for NPD:** 

This exercise is all about getting students to think creatively and come up with cool product ideas. Exploring AI tools for that, they'll get a taste of how well they work in such a setting. Students will also learn how to talk about their ideas, draw them out visually, and then tweak them based on what others think. Plus, it's a chance for them to see how different skills, like tech know-how, design, and basic business smarts, can all come together when making something new. It's all about learning by doing and having a good time while at it!

Let's get started!
