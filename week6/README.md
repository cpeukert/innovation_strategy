# Exercise week 6: A/B testing

In this exercise, we will analyze data from an A/B test.

The experimentation team has set up an A/B test in which some users see design A (control group) and some users see design B (treatment group).

You can find the data in https://github.com/cpeukert/innovation_strategy/blob/main/week6/ab_test.csv.

The variables are user_id, treatment, and clicks.

Use Excel (or another software you prefer) to find out which design causes more clicks.

- Estimate the effect!
- Visualize the effect!

A solution with some addition elements can be found here: https://github.com/cpeukert/innovation_strategy/blob/main/week6/AB-Test.xlsx

## Learning Goals

Throughout this exercise, we aim to achieve the following learning goals:

- **Understand how simple the analysis of experimental data can be** 

Engaging with the A/B testing exercise provides hands-on experience in processing and interpreting data from controlled experiments. By distinguishing between a control and treatment group, students will become familiar with fundamental concepts underlying experimental design.

Let's get started!
